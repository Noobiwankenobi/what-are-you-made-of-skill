I'm mostly made of steel. i'm embarassed to admit it because the steel indu6.7% of the world's global emissions.
I'm made of a number of different materials. it's hard to name all of them. mostly, i'm made from steel, which i am a bit ashamed of. steel is a huge source of carbon emissions, but it is also a very versatile and robust material. just look at how good i look after 50 years of being in operation!
